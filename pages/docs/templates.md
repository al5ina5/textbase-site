# Templates

## Templates in textbase.js are really simple.

> **NOTE** You can skip most of this process running `textbase eject` in your project directory. This will spit out textbase's default theme to your project directory, allowing you to dissect it directly. This might be a better option if you know what you're doing.

We tried to make sure theming in textbase.js as easy as possible. We didn't want there to a be a learning curve. We wanted to empower you to use the skills you already know to design your textbase.js webisteâ€”not learn new ones.

Templates in textbase.js are made just like standard html5 websites.

Our templates `index.html` is responsible for the result of every page generated from the `./pages` folder.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Docs</title>

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">
</head>

<body>
    {{{html}}}
</body>

</html>
```

Good ol' plain HTML.

You'll notice the `<body>` of the templates `index.html` is nearly empty. During build time, the markdown in your `/pages/*.md` will be plugged into `{{{html}}}` as carefully crafted HTML.

You'll also notice we've linked a stylesheet.

At this point, your template is just 2 files.

```
ðŸ—‚ templates
ðŸ“‚ ---- yourtemplate
ðŸ“„ -------- index.html
ðŸ“„ -------- style.css
```

## Classless Styling

Classless styling is the _new_ hip way to style your pages effectively in the absolutely way possible.

> **NOTE** textbase.js's default is a modified version of the classless css framework [new.css](https://newcss.net/).

Since the markdown you write in your `./pages` will be generated into bare html (no classes by default), we recommend style html's default tags, such as `h1`, `h2`, `p`, `code` and more.

```
h1 {
    font-size: 2.25rem
}

h2 {
    font-size: 1.85rem
}

h3 {
    font-size: 1.55rem
}
```

We suggest starting your textbase.js website with our base css styling, and adding your custom styles as you desire. You can do so by importing `textbase-light` or `textbase-dark` into your `./style.css` file.

```
@import "https://unpkg.com/textbase-light";
@import "https://unpkg.com/textbase-dark";
```

## Importing your template

Once your template is ready to go, you'll need to set it as the active template.

Create a `./_textbase.js` file in you project root. This file should be adjacent to your `./pages` folder.

> **TIP** You can view all the options available in `./_textbase.js` [here](/options.html).

Populate `./pages/index.md` with the following contents:

```
modules.exports = {
    themeFolder: './templates/yourtheme'
}
```
