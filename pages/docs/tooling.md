# Tooling

If you're an absolute beginner, fret not! Some of the concepts of the textbase.js may be hard to comprehend.

We created this page to list some recommend tools to make it easier to get started with textbase.js.

# TextBase Desktop (Coming soon...)

TextBase Desktop is a desktop application used to develop websites using textbase.js. TextBase Desktop is not quite ready for public usage, but we'll be running a beta within the next week. Our goal is to make TextBase Desktop easy enough for the common public to use—with no other tools or knowledge required.

## NodeJS

NodeJS is the _only_ requirement. Simply download, run, and install it and you'll be good to go.

## VS Code

You can use any text editor you like (TextEdit on macOS, NotePad on Windows), but the recommended text editor is VS Code. You can think of VS Code like a Microsoft word on steroids—built for developers.
